    <p>A 15-minute drive or 30-minute bus ride from Brasov leads to Poiana Brasov (3,300 feet), a mountaintop ski and summer resort. During winter months, Poiana Brasov offers some of the best skiing in Romania. In the summer, it is a great place for hikers to launch treks into the Southern Carpathian Mountains. For a panoramic view of Brasov and the more distant Bucegi Mountains, take the cable car to the summit of Postavarul Mountain (5,756 feet).</p>
    <p>Hollywood celebrities Jude Law, Renee Zellweger and Nicole Kidman relaxed in Poiana Brasov after shooting the film Cold Mountain on location in nearby fields and farms.</p>

    <p>Included by FatherMag.com in the list of "top 50 destinations in Europe that every kid and family should experience at least once in their lifetime" Dino Parc - Râșnov , close to Brașov, is the place to be for kids that are fascinated by dinosaurs. While hiking and trekking through the park visitors will see over 100 models of real-size dinosaurs. There are many playgrounds, treehouses, adventure trails, laser labyrinths, state-of-the-art cinemas as well as virtual reality interactive areas and an erupting interactive volcano.</p>
    <p>Recently, the old fortress has been restored to its former glory and today, you can visit the impressive remains. There is also a museum here, hidden behind the ancient walls, where you can find a skeleton buried beneath a glass floor, as well as some other interesting artifacts. The inner rooms are maze-like, with several wooden ladders linking them and a few so-called secret passages which should keep you busy for quite awhile.</p>
